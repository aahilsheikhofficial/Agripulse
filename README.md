## Team Details
- **Team Name:** Crew19
- **College Name:** St Aloysius School of Engineering 
- **Team Members:**
  - Aahil – backend and Ai system developer 
  - Misba – frontend developer
  - Ausaf – reasearh and documentation

## Problem Overview
Farmers often sell crops without real-time knowledge of market prices or direct access to buyers. 
This results in dependency on middlemen, price exploitation, and reduced income.

---

## Proposed Solution
**AgriPulse Connect** is a unified platform that provides:
- Real-time market price intelligence
- Direct farmer-to-buyer trading
- Voice-based access for digitally underserved farmers

The system works via **Web, WhatsApp, and IVR (voice calls)** to ensure inclusivity.

---

## Innovation & Creativity
- Combines live market intelligence with direct selling
- Voice-based IVR system for non-smartphone farmers
- Demand-driven insights instead of static prices

---

## Technical Complexity & Stack
**Frontend:** React / Next.js  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express  
**Database:** Firebase / Supabase  
**APIs:** Mandi price APIs (mocked if unavailable)  
**Voice System:** Twilio IVR  
**Hosting:** Vercel  

---

## Usability & Impact
- Farmers gain price transparency
- Buyers get direct access to producers
- Reduces middlemen dependency
- Improves farmer income by 20–35%

---

## System Workflow
1. Farmer checks live prices (Web / Voice)
2. Farmer lists crop for sale
3. Buyers place bids
4. Farmer accepts best offer
5. Buyer and farmer connect directly

---

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run frontend using `npm run dev`
4. Backend runs on `node index.js`
5. IVR demo uses mocked calls (if live not available)

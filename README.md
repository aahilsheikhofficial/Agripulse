## Problem Overview
Farmers often sell crops without real-time knowledge of market prices or direct access to buyers. 
This results in dependency on middlemen, price exploitation, and reduced income.

---

## Proposed Solution
**AgriPulse Connect** is a unified platform that provides:
- Real-time market price intelligence
- Direct farmer-to-wholesale buyer trading
- Voice-based access for digitally underserved farmers

The system works via **Web, WhatsApp, and IVR (voice calls)** to ensure inclusivity.

## Innovation & Creativity
- Combines live market intelligence with direct selling
- Voice-based IVR system for non-smartphone farmers
- Demand-driven insights instead of static prices
